## Caniot Tools

Caniot tool is a Multi-platform simulation, analysis and test environment for development and test of CAN/LIN/KLine Automotive bus systems.It consists of caniot application and caniotBox. Simplicity is the highest principle when setting up, operating and expanding the system.


## Features

* Caniot Tool can be used on Windows 10,11, Linux(Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS) ,macOS Monterey and Android.
* stream real-time CAN/LIN data to your own MQTT Server.
* intuitive Caniot application for analysis: user panels, signal plots, dashboards, trace window.
* DBC/LDF decode data to physical values and plot.
* Support ISO-TP 15765-2 and UDS ISO 14229.
* CaniotBox has simple logger which writes all messages from CAN/LIN bus to csv file on a SD card class 10 (8-32GB).
* Flexible and reusable LVGL GUI framework.
* Pmodâ„¢ compatible headers support expand peripheral modules(V3.0).

### Quick Start

* **Step 1**. Run command `git clone --recursive https://github.com/caniot/caniot_tools.git` to download the source of this project.
* **Step 2**. install Caniot Application for your OS [caniot app](./caniot_app).
* **Step 3**. ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) is required to build caniotBox application. If this is your first time using the ESP-IDF,Please refer to [ESP-IDF(release/v4.4.4) Installation Step by Step](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.4/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step).
* **Step 4**. now you can build a CAN example[build a CAN example](./Examples/CAN).
